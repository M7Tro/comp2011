Note: You don't have to handle non-integers or negative input.

You should upload your modified lab1.cpp to ZINC. You don't need to zip the cpp file if you only upload a single C++ file.

DO NOT use cerr because ZINC cannot grade cerr output. You can check this problem by following the checking procedures below.

DO NOT return a non-zero return code (e.g., return -1;) in the main function. ZINC will treat your program as "crash" and won't continue the grading.

Command suggested for compilation: g++ -std=c++11 lab1.cpp -o lab1


You need to redirect the input of executable program to the txt test case files we provided, and redirect the output to different txt files. Here is the command for MacOS: ./lab1 < testcase/input1.txt > myOutput1.txt

VScode offers a cool feature with "select for compare" and "compare with selected"

Grading Scheme: 1 point for attendance, 1 point for a successful ZINC submission (lab1.cpp, the filename is case-sensitive) that passes ALL the seen and unseen test cases, 1 point for the Q&A session with the TA if he/she gives the correct answer to TA's question (list of selected students will only be shown during the lab session; If the student is not selected for the Q&A, then the ZINC submission will count for 2 points;)

To edit the same word in multiple places, select the word and use Ctrl+D / Cmd+D.

DS_Store — or Desktop Services Store — files for each folder. These files are useful for keeping track of metadata and folder settings, like folder view options, sort options, and icon size and position

You can view the timeline of changes in VS Code using View -> Open View -> Timeline (gets cluttered with autosave)

Anywhere on the file do a double-tap and press Format Document to ... format the document. It means making the source code less ugly with spaces, tabs/indentation.
