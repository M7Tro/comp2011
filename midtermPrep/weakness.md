file for writing down topics where I feel fear:


File IO

String class

type casting 

enum 

Reference variables.

Using/passing const references


cin.getline, cin.gcount()

    While we specify the max amount of characters for cin.getline() as a second argument, I do not understand how they are counted.
    Similarly, I do not understand how cin.gcount() counts the characters.


I don't understand how the tower of Hanoi recursive solution was derived. I don't think I would be able to solve this problem if it was given on the exam. 

binary search funciton. Can't quite figure out how to make it work in all cases. I also don't undertand the base case from the solution where function quites at last first. I should also check out the non-recursive solution.
