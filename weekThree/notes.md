Today is september 17th. 

I have just finished making notes on the new lecture topic: "functions".

Basically, the coolest stuff so far is passing by reference and passing by value. 

I also need to spend some time getting comfortable with new jargon: format list, actual list.

What is the difference between declaration, definition and initializatin? 

Declaration -> introducing a new name. Existence.

Definition -> a definition of a previously declared name. A declaration is a definition unless it declares a function without a body. Essence.

Initialization -> assignment of a value. Does not mean much for a function. Value.
